    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cinnamon Roll Oatmeal is a creamy convenient bake-free recipe. The results are everything you love about cinnamon buns but in a chewy, hearty, and healthy package.  <em>snack</em>. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    

<ul>
    <li>1/2 cup rolled oats (gluten-free, if needed)</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 tablespoon cinnamon</li>
    <li>1 cup milk (any type, such as almond or dairy)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons sugar (or sweetener of choice)</li>
    <li>1 scoop protein powder (optional)</li>
    <li>1-2 tablespoons cream cheese</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Simmer: Combine all ingredients (except cream cheese) in a saucepan or microwave-safe bowl. Heat until most of the liquid has been absorbed. If using protein powder, stir it in at the end.</li>
    <li>Add cream cheese: Remove the oats from heat and stir in the cream cheese. Serve with extra cinnamon.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Tips & Variations</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Extra protein:</strong> Swap cream cheese for Greek yogurt and add 1-2 tablespoons of powdered sugar (or a sugar substitute).</li>
    <li><strong>Adjust the liquid:</strong> If the oats are too thick, start with ½ cup of milk and add 1-2 tablespoons more as needed.</li>
    <li><strong>Increase the ratios:</strong> The base recipe uses a ½ cup of oats to 1 cup of milk. For every extra ½ cup of oats, increase the milk by ¾ cup. If you prefer thicker oatmeal, only increase by ½ cup.</li>
</ul>
